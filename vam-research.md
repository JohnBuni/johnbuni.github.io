# Volumetric Additive Manufacturing Research

## Overview
This project briefly describes my undergraduate research in **Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (VAM)**, a novel 3D printing process capable of fabricating entire parts simultaneously through tomographic light projection.

## Objective
The goal of this research was to understand and optimize how resin properties and process parameters influence curing behavior, dimensional accuracy, and achievable part size in a tomographic VAM system.

## Experimental Approach
Experiments were conducted using a projector-based volumetric additive manufacturing setup with SLA-type photopolymer resins. The process involves projecting a series of 2D images, derived from slicing a 3D CAD model, into a resin volume such that the object cures simultaneously in three dimensions. Figures 1 and 2 depict the experimental setup and the formation of an object during a representative test trial, respectively.

Key variables investigated included:
- Photo-initiator concentration (wt%)
- Resin mixing time prior to exposure
- Thermal conditions during resin preparation
- Exposure parameters and part geometry

Performance was evaluated based on:
- Dimensional accuracy
- Cure completeness
- Curing time
- Observed failure modes

## Key Findings
The experiments and modeling established clear relationships between resin penetration depth and achievable part dimensions in a volumetric additive manufacturing process. Experimental measurements supported the analytical model, demonstrating how material properties and system geometry constrain curing behavior and feasible object size. These findings provide practical insight into how resin characteristics influence process limits and design considerations for volumetric 3D printing systems.
