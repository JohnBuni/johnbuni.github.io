# Volumetric Additive Manufacturing Research

## Overview
This project summarizes my undergraduate research in **Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (VAM)**, a novel 3D printing process capable of fabricating entire parts simultaneously through tomographic light projection.

## Objective
The goal of this research was to understand and optimize how resin properties and process parameters influence curing behavior, dimensional accuracy, and achievable part size in a tomographic VAM system.

## Experimental Approach
Experiments were conducted using a projector-based volumetric additive manufacturing setup with SLA-type photopolymer resins. The process involves projecting a sequence of 2D images—derived from slicing a 3D CAD model—into a resin volume so that the object cures simultaneously in three dimensions.

**Figure 1** shows the experimental setup, and **Figure 2** illustrates the formation of an object during a representative test trial.
